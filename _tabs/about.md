### 🌟 Building User-First Services, Not Just Technology-Driven Ones

I strive to develop services that deliver real value to users — not just by building what’s technically impressive, but by applying technology in ways that matter.

My interests lie in the following areas, and while I still have a lot to learn, I'm continuously growing and improving:

#### 🧠 AI
- **Application of LLMs**: Exploring how large language models can enhance various processes, including data preprocessing.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Personalizing item serving for each user.
- **Ontology & Graph Neural Networks**: Structuring and representing user preferences systematically.
- **Anything That Makes a Service Smarter and More Helpful**

#### 🛠️ Backend
- Serving AI services fast and efficiently — from APIs to scalable architecture.

#### ⚙️ MLOps
- Leveraging tools like **Airflow**, **MLflow**, and **BentoML** to streamline AI research, experimentation, and deployment.

#### 🧱 Infrastructure
- Making the most of the resources we have through efficient infra design and ops strategy.
